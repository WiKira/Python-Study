# Setup and Context

### Introduction

On November 27, 1895, Alfred Nobel signed his last will in Paris. When it was opened after his death, the will caused a lot of controversy, as Nobel had left much of his wealth for the establishment of a prize.

Alfred Nobel dictates that his entire remaining estate should be used to endow “prizes to those who, during the preceding year, have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind”.

Every year the Nobel Prize is given to scientists and scholars in the categories chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine, economics, and peace.

Let's see what patterns we can find in the data of the past Nobel laureates. What can we learn about the Nobel prize and our world more generally?

"""### Descriptive Statistics for the Laureate Age at Time of Award

* Calculate the descriptive statistics for the age at the time of the award.
* Then visualise the distribution in the form of a histogram using [Seaborn's .histplot() function](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.histplot.html).
* Experiment with the `bin` size. Try 10, 20, 30, and 50.  
"""





"""### Age at Time of Award throughout History

Are Nobel laureates being nominated later in life than before? Have the ages of laureates at the time of the award increased or decreased over time?

**Challenge**

* Use Seaborn to [create a .regplot](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.regplot.html?highlight=regplot#seaborn.regplot) with a trendline.
* Set the `lowess` parameter to `True` to show a moving average of the linear fit.
* According to the best fit line, how old were Nobel laureates in the years 1900-1940 when they were awarded the prize?
* According to the best fit line, what age would it predict for a Nobel laureate in 2020?

"""





"""### Winning Age Across the Nobel Prize Categories

How does the age of laureates vary by category?

* Use Seaborn's [`.boxplot()`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.boxplot.html?highlight=boxplot#seaborn.boxplot) to show how the mean, quartiles, max, and minimum values vary across categories. Which category has the longest "whiskers"?
* In which prize category are the average winners the oldest?
* In which prize category are the average winners the youngest?
"""





"""**Challenge**
* Now use Seaborn's [`.lmplot()`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.lmplot.html?highlight=lmplot#seaborn.lmplot) and the `row` parameter to create 6 separate charts for each prize category. Again set `lowess` to `True`.
* What are the winning age trends in each category?
* Which category has the age trending up and which category has the age trending down?
* Is this `.lmplot()` telling a different story from the `.boxplot()`?
* Create another chart with Seaborn. This time use `.lmplot()` to put all 6 categories on the same chart using the `hue` parameter.
